# Base CloudFormation Template Repository

# Description

This is our collection of troposphere scripts for manufacturing base templates
for use in deploying common AWS infrastructure components. Base templates
intentionally provide broad access to resource configuration and are intended to
be used in nested stacks, which can give you more fine grained control over
final configuration of a complete infrastructure solution.

Templates generated by this code may make certain assumptions or enforce certain
standards that should be checked against the needs of your organization prior to
use. Where applicable, the authors will strive to document such choices and why
those choices were made.

## Common Components

- VPC and Subnets
- Security Groups
- Auto-Scale Groups
- DBaaS
- Route53 and Domains
- Cloudwatch Alarms
- Dashboards
- Log Aggregation
- Code Delivery/Deployment

This is a living list; it may grow at any time. It is not necessarily the goal
of this repository to cover every common component or component group on the
list. Some common components may not be supported by or fully exposed through
CloudFormation, and some may simply not be able to be genericized in a portable
way.

# Troposphere

[Troposphere](https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere) is a python library for
generating CloudFormation templates. It allows us to leverage python's logical
structures when we're designing our templates to ease the burden of authoring
and maintaining those templates.
